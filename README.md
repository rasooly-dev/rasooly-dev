### 👋 Hello, World!

_"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." – Cory House_

I'm Abdulrasol Alofi, a passionate **Software Developer** and **AI Enthusiast** currently studying Computer Science at UC Davis 🎓. With a solid foundation in AI and full-stack development, I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between users and technology! Maybe even combining AI + Healthcare from time to time _cough cough 😮‍💨_

### 🚀 Recent Adventures
- **Software Developer @ Remadi Holdings:** Developing an AI-powered mental health platform, enhancing patient care with data-driven insights 🧠💻.
- **VP of Technology @ CodeLab Davis:** Coordinating teams to create cutting-edge AI/ML-driven products and mentoring the next generation of developers 🌱.
- **Co-Founding Engineer @ DSNR:** Played a pivotal role in developing and scaling DSNR, an AI image generation startup that was recently acquired. I optimized backend services, enabling the platform to support 200+ concurrent sessions and serve 12K+ users 🌐🤖.

### 💡 Passion Project: Healthcare Meets AI
I'm currently diving deep into a personal project where I'm combining my love for AI with healthcare. My goal is to create innovative solutions that make healthcare more accessible and efficient through intelligent technology 🏥✨.
